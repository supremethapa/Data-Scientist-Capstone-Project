    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."

    "# Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the information given above, this project will try to ask the questions below:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- What are the main factors that define the usage of offers by customers? (Feature Importances)\n",
    "- Probabilty that the customer will open and use the offer sent to them? (Effectiveness of the offer)\n",
    "- Is there anything common between customers that we can deduce using demographics who take up an offer?\n",

    "# Road Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the questions above, given the data sets provided, the following steps will seperate the data set into three types of offer and fit the data into three supervised classification models. Using this way, the model can predict whether the offer will be responded by the customers or not when sent to them. Also, by checking the feature importance of the model, we can answer the question that what factors are main for an offer to be effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I'll initiate the simple decision tree classifier model as a baseline model. And I'll also use random forest as an comparison to baseline model to see if I could get a better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I will use a regression model to see if we could predict the amount a user would spend, given that the offer is effectively influencing them."

There also may be scenarios where an offer completed occurs after the offer is viewed, but a transaction was done prior to the offer being viewed. In this instance, the offer may have been completed, but it is also not a valid conversion.\n",

As already stated above, group 2 would be within our definition of an ineffective offer; where a user is aware of an offer, but the offer is ineffective as it does not convert the user into a customer. So group 2 can be defined as our target variable \"effective_offer\" = 0.\n",

The objective of offers are to drive purchases, so it would already be the case that users with high spend in their transactions would be flagged as effective_offers.\n",

However, for those transctions where offer_completed=0, I have not considered them, and this could be a potential feature to include, as a proxy for the 'baseline' level of spending for a user.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I found this project challenging, mainly due to the structure of the data in the `transcript` dataset. I had started out with 2 business questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the main features influencing the effectiveness of an offer on the Starbucks app?\n",
    "2. Could the data provided, namely offer characteristics and user demographics, predict whether a user would take up an offer?\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Reflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Question 1 findings:\n",
    "For Question 1, the feature importance given by all 3 models were that the tenure of a member is the biggest predictor of the effectiveness of an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all three models, the top 3 variables were the same - membership tenure, income and age. However, income and age switched orders depending on offer type. \n",
    "\n",
    "For BOGO and discount offers, the distribution of feature importances were relatively equal. However, for informational offers, the distribution is slightly more balanced, with income the second most important variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Question 2 findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "My decision to use 3 separate models to predict the effectiveness of each offer type ended up with good accuracy for the BOGO and discount models (82.87% for BOGO and 87.38% for discount), while slightly less accurate performance for informational offers (75.23%). However, I would regard 75% as acceptable in a business setting, as for informational offers, there is no cost involved to inform users of a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, for BOGO and discount models, I am quite happy with the 80% and above accuracy, as in a business setting that would be acceptable to show offers to people, even if the model misclassifies a few, the overall revenue increase might justify the few mistakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Main challenges and potential improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "When analysing and building the machine learning models to answer the above questions, reflections on my main challenges and findings are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Attribution framework for assigning offer_ids for transactions:\n",

    "In order to answer Question 1, I had to first define what an 'effective offer' means using the transactional records. This proved to be the trickiest portion of the project. I had to define a funnel for what what an effective conversion would look like, as we had data on both effective and noneffective conversions. Thus, I was desigining an attribution model for the conversion events (`offer completed` and `transaction` events) based on the events that occurred prior for each person.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up having to separate the users into 4 different pools, based on their actions in the transcript data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Group 1: People who are influenced by offers and thus purchase/complete the offer(successful/effective conversion of offer)\n",
    "- Group 2: People who receive and an offer but is not influenced and thus no conversion event (ineffective conversion of offer)\n",
    "- Group 3: People who have conversion events but was not actually influenced by an offer\n",
    "- Group 4: People who receive offers but no views or action taken\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after separating the groups, it was challenging to assign the people in group 3 based on the transactional data. I had to define the event space where the right sequence of events would occur before I could assign an offer id to transactions (which did not have an offer_id), essentally designing a event/sequence-based attribution window.\n",

    "#### ii. Feature engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding on what features to re-engineer and how to engineer for an effective model. At the end, our reengineered feature of membership tenure was indeed the most important feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iii. Model implementation decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "I had made the decision to build 3 separate models depending on offer types based on my definition of the problem statement - as I wanted to discover what would drive an effective offer, I thought it made more sense to remove noise from the data by separating the data into the offer types. My decision ended up to be quite a good one as the single BOGO and discount models got good performance in testing scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the info model, the accuracy was slightly worse as we had less records overall. As elaborated above, I believe that if we had more data, I could have gotten the accuracy higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional note on model selection - I selected tree-based models as I wanted to assess feature importance, but I could have extended this study further by testing a parametric/ regression model (e.g. logistic regression for classification tasks). The weights of the coefficients from a regression model might have been interesting to contrast with the feature importance of a tree-based model, given that both models have different ways of analysing the data. The feature `membership_tenure_days` might not have been the highest weighted feature, in contrast to how it was in this study.\n",

    "\n",
    "Due to time reasons, I couldn't get a chance to try some other enhancement in the step of model tuning. For example, probably, I can do some more experiment on feature engineering step to see if any other new features can improve the model, also I could also try to reduce some feature to see how it will affect the model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, so far the analysis is focused more on customer's who successfully finish the transaction after they received the offer, there should be more insight for the other cases where the customer finishes the transactions regardless of the offer. If we could get any insight into those cases, maybe we can send out more offers to those customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I was thinking if I could do some unsupervised learning on clustering the customers based on information we are given, to see if there are any specific characteristics on a group of customers who will be more likely to respond to the offer."
